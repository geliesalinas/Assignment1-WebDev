    <p>On 2019, I successfully completed my senior high school as a HUMSS(Humanities and Social Sciences) student in Phinma University of Pangasinan. </p>
    <p>It is really challenging when I entered college because of the difference of what I have completed in senior high school compared to my course now.</p>
    <p>But I felt relieved that I was able to cope up with my new environment.</p>
    <p>I am currently in my second year of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Pangasinan State University, Urdaneta City Campus.</p>
    <p>College life is challenging, yes, but I know that this will make me stronger in the future.</p>
